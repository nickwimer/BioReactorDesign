	abstract = {Large-scale fermentation processes involve complex dynamic interactions between mixing, reaction, mass transfer, and the suspended biomass. Empirical correlations or case-specific computational simulations are usually used to predict and estimate the performance of large-scale bioreactors based on data acquired at bench scale. In this two-part-study, one-dimensional axial diffusion equations were studied as a general and predictive model of large-scale bioreactors. This second part focused on typical fed-batch operations where substrate gradients are known to occur, and characterized the profiles of substrate, pH, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and temperature. The physically grounded steady-state axial diffusion equations with first- and zeroth-order kinetics yielded analytical solutions to the relevant variables. The results were compared with large-scale Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae experiments and simulations from the literature, and good agreement was found in substrate profiles. The analytical profiles obtained for dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, and CO 2 \{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}textCO\_2{\textbackslash} were also consistent with the available data. Distribution functions for the substrate were defined, and efficiency factors for biomass growth and oxygen uptake rate were derived. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that axial diffusion equations can be used to model the effects of mixing and reaction on the relevant variables of typical large-scale fed-batch fermentations.},

The model evokes a time-accurate solution to the fluid velocity field and overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient, as well as the ongoing effects of interfacial mass transfer, species mixing, and aqueous chemical reactions. The modeled system also includes a direct coupling between process variables and system control variables via embedded controller logic. Satisfactory agreement is realized between the model prediction and measured bioreactor data in terms of the steady-state operating conditions and the response to setpoint changes.

	abstract = {The formation of pH gradients in a 700 L batch fermentation of Streptococcus thermophilus was studied using multi-position pH measurements and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. To this end, a dynamic, kinetic model of S. thermophilus and a pH correlation were integrated into a validated one-phase CFD model, and a dynamic CFD simulation was performed. First, the fluid dynamics of the CFD model were validated with NaOH tracer pulse mixing experiments. Mixing experiments and simulations were performed whereas multiple pH sensors, which were placed vertically at different locations in the bioreactor, captured the response. A mixing time of about 46 s to reach 95\% homogeneity was measured and predicted at an impeller speed of 242 rpm. The CFD simulation of the S. thermophilus fermentation captured the experimentally observed pH gradients between a pH of 5.9 and 6.3, which occurred during the exponential growth phase. A pH higher than 7 was predicted in the vicinity of the base solution inlet. Biomass growth, lactic acid production, and substrate consumption matched the experimental observations. Moreover, the biokinetic results obtained from the CFD simulation were similar to a single-compartment simulation, for which a homogeneous distribution of the pH was assumed. This indicates no influence of pH gradients on growth in the studied bioreactor. This study verified that the pH gradients during a fermentation in the pilot-scale bioreactor could be accurately predicted using a coupled simulation of a biokinetic and a CFD model. To support the understanding and optimization of industrial-scale processes, future biokinetic CFD studies need to assess multiple types of environmental gradients, like pH, substrate, and dissolved oxygen, especially at industrial scale.},

	abstract = {Renewable terephthalic and 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acids can be produced from biomass via muconic acid using a combination of biological and chemical processes. In this conversion scheme, cis,cis-mucononic acid is first obtained by fermentation using either sugar or lignin monomers as a feedstock. The diunsaturated cis,cis-diacid is then isomerized to trans,trans-muconic acid, reacted with biobased ethylene through Diels–Alder cycloaddition, and further hydrogenated or dehydrogenated to yield the desired 100\% renewable cyclic dicarboxylic acid. The isomerization of cis,cis- to trans,trans-muconic acid represents the main bottleneck in this process due to undesired side reactions that promote ring closing to form lactones. Therefore, new technologies for the selective isomerization of muconic acid are urgently needed. Here, we studied the corresponding reaction kinetics to elucidate the mechanisms involved in both the isomerization and cyclization reactions with the objective to identify conditions that favor the selective formation of trans,trans-muconic acid. We demonstrate that the reactivity of muconic acid in aqueous media strongly depends on pH. Under alkaline conditions, cis,cis-muconic acid is deprotonated to the corresponding muconate dianion. This species is stable for extended periods of time and does not isomerize. Conversely, cis,cis-muconic acid readily isomerizes to its cis,trans-isomer under acidic conditions. Prolonged heating further triggers the intramolecular cyclizations through reaction of the carboxylic acid and alkene functionalities. The formation of the muconolactone and its dilactone is kinetically favored over the isomerization to trans,trans-muconic acid over a broad range of conditions. However, strategies involving the chelation of the carboxylates with inorganic salts or their solvation using polar aprotic solvents were found to hamper the ring closing reactions and allow the isomerization to trans,trans-muconic acid to proceed with high selectivity (88\%). The obtained compound was further reacted with ethylene and hydrogenated to 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, an important monomer for the polyester and polyamide industries.},

However, their actual time scales may stretch far into the microsecond range, as acid–base reactions are diffusion controlled and the concentrations are low near neutral pH. The interplay of competing bases in the pH relaxation is illustrated using a model acid–base system consisting of o-nitrobenzaldehyde (oNBA) as a proton cage and acetate ions and hydroxyl ions as bases. The kinetically controlled behavior leads to highly counterintuitive states, i.e. acetate ions are transiently protonated for hundreds of nanoseconds despite the presence of a much stronger base OH–.},

	abstract = {While many studies have reported on the oxidation kinetics of ammonia and amines with the hydroxyl radical (OH) in the gas phase, the analogous reactions in the aqueous phase have not been adequately studied. In this work, the reaction rate constants of ammonia, dimethylamine (DMA) and diethylamine (DEA) with hydroxyl radicals in the aqueous phase were investigated using ion chromatography. The neutral and protonated forms of each base were shown to have differing rate constants with OH by performing the measurements over a range of pH from 7.0 to 11.0. Excess hydrogen peroxide was used as the precursor for hydroxyl radicals, while monochloroacetic acid and benzoic acid were chosen as the reference compounds for the relative rate method. The rate constants of both protonated forms and neutral forms were calculated for DMA ((9.5 ± 1.2) ×106 M−1 s−1 and (3.3 ± 0.2) ×109 M−1 s−1) and DEA ((1.5 ± 0.4) × 108 M−1 s−1 and (4.9 ± 0.1) × 109 M−1 s−1) using the relative rate method. The rate constant of ammonium ion and neutral ammonia were calculated to be (2.3 ± 0.5) × 106 M−1 s−1 and (1.8 ± 0.4) × 108 M−1 s−1, respectively. With a pKa of 9.25, the rate constant of the protonated form is applicable to the overall rate constant of ammonia at pH {\textless}7, indicating that this oxidation pathway is not a significant sink for ammonia in acidic aqueous environments. Because of their partitioning characteristics, oxidation of DMA and DEA by OH in aerosol particles could be competitive with oxidation in the gas phase.},
