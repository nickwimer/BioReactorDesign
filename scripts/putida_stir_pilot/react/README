This case is assuming you have run the non-reacting case

1) Take the final reconstructed solution at 600 seconds from non-reacting case and move it to
this folder. This can be obtained by running reconstructPar -time 600 in the non-reacting case folder.

2) Change the startTime in system/controldict to the current reconstructed file.
Change final time based on how many fluid updates you will do in a 12 hour reaction 
period. 

3) Also move the constant/polymesh folder from non reacting case to constant folder here.
This is to use the same mesh as the non-reacting case.

4) Set fluid update time - this is the fluid solver is run between 2 reaction updates.
set reaction update time - I am using 2 hours. But need to play with this to get an 
optimal update time that is computational efficient and yields convergent results when 
coupled with CFD.

5) run the ofoamjob script.

6) The code outputs a text file called timehist.dat. This gives a table with
time, microbe_conc,  glucose, Xylose, Acetoin, BDO, OUR. There is also a file called wellmixed.dat that the 
code generates. This is the well-mixed case without CFD which is done to verify Jim Lischeske's model.


7) use pv_extract_analyse script to reconstruct plotfiles and average O2 and hold-up.run pvjob.
